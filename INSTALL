the following libraries are required:

libmagic-dev
libmicrohttpd-dev (>=0.9.17)
libow-dev (>=2.8p13)

To "compile" the images to png one will also need to install
inkscape and xcftools.

As of Debian squeeze the following backports need to be
installed:

libow-dev_2.8p13+dfsg1-5-5_<arch>.deb
libow-2.8-13_2.8p13+dfsg1-5_<arch>.deb
libowcapi-2.8-13_2.8p13+dfsg1-5_<arch>.deb
libmicrohttpd10_0.9.17-1_<arch>.deb
libmicrohttpd-dev_0.9.17-1_<arch>.deb

libmagic-dev can be installed via aptitude/apt-get.

To cross compile for ARM use "dpkg-cross -i" and "xapt" instead of the
generic dpkg and apt-get commands.

If all these dependencies are fulfilled, to cross-compile for
ARM just using the following command:

make CC=arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc

A Debian package can be cross-build using the following command:
dpkg-buildpackage -b -aarmel
